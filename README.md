# Abhinav-Resume
**How to Use**

1. Easiest way it to download everything as a folder and upload it as a project to Overleaf. Compile the resume.tex file and you are good to go :)
2. For a fancy way to complie latex file refer below: (section taken from parent/acknowledge repo)
    
    **Requirements**

    A full TeX distribution is assumed. Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, *nix) are available but TeX Live is recommended. You       can install TeX from upstream (recommended; most up-to-date) or use sudo apt-get install texlive-full if you really want that. (It's generally a few years behind.)

    **Usage**

    At a command prompt, run

    $ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
    This should result in the creation of {your-cv}.pdf
